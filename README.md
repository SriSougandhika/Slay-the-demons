# Slay-the-demons
A simple demon-slaying game built using PyGame module
The player or the swordsman has to slay the demons approaching him. If he slays 10 demons, he wins. Each slay gets you a point.
If the player does not get 10 points and demon reaches him first, then you lose.

Happy playing!

NOTE:
The code reference has been taken from elsewhere, but the game is built by myself. It might bear resemblance with multiple games. I do not intend to plagiarise anyone's work. I am trying these out as an exercise for fun! Thanks!
